SYNOPSIS
========

sddm [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
===========

sddm is a display and login manager based on Qt technologies.

Using QtQuick and QML, designers are given the ability to
easily create pleasant, modern looking interfaces for sddm.

sddm runs the greeter as a system user named **sddm**
whose home directory needs to be set to **/var/lib/sddm**.

If pam and systemd are available, the greeter will go through logind,
which will give it access to drm devices.

Distributions without pam and systemd will need to put the **sddm** user
into the **video** group, otherwise errors regarding GL and drm devices
might be experienced.

OPTIONS
=======

--test-mode
	Start daemon in test mode.

--help, -h
	Show help message and exit.
