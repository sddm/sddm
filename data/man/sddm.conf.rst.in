DESCRIPTION
===========

This file configures various parameters of the sddm display manager **sddm**\(1\).
If this file is not available, default values are used.

OPTIONS
=======

[General] section:

`DisplayServer=`
	Select the display server to use for the greeter.
	Valid values are:

	* `x11`: X server running as root.
	* `x11-user`: X server running as unprivileged user.
	* `wayland`: Wayland compositor as unprivileged user. (Experimental)

	Default value is "x11".
	For `x11-user` you might need to configure Xorg.wrap(1).

`HaltCommand=`
	Halt command.
	Default value is "@HALT_COMMAND@".

`RebootCommand=`
	Reboot command.
	Default value is "@REBOOT_COMMAND@".

`Numlock=`
	Change numlock state when **sddm-greeter** starts.
	Valid values are `on`, `off` or `none`.
	If property is set to `none`, numlock won't be changed.
	Default value is "none".

`InputMethod=`
        Set the Qt input method for the greeter.
        Tablet users with Qt Virtual Keyboard installed can set this
        to "qtvirtualkeyboard" for the on-screen keyboard.
        Other known values are "ibus" for the Intelligent Input Bus,
        or "compose" for dead keys support.
        Leave this empty if unsure.

`Namespaces=`
	Comma-separated list of paths bound to Linux namespaces to enter with
	setns() before starting the user session.  For example, to enter network
	namespace `mynet` created with `ip netns add mynet`, the value might be
	`/run/netns/mynet`.  Default value is empty.  (The value is ignored if
	the operating system is not Linux.)

`DefaultSession=`
	Defines the session file name that will get selected by default.
	In case `RememberLastSession` is enabled and there is a last session
	available, that last session will be selected, ignoring this option.
	Default value is empty.

[Theme] section:

`ThemeDir=`
	Path of the directory containing theme files.
	Default value is "@DATA_INSTALL_DIR@/themes".

`Current=`
	Name of the current theme.
	By default this setting is empty, meaning the embedded theme
	will be used.

`FacesDir=`
	Path of the directory containing face files,
	face files should be in username.face.icon format.
	Default value is "@DATA_INSTALL_DIR@/faces".

`CursorTheme=`
	Name of the cursor theme to be set before starting
	the display server.

`CursorSize=`
	Cursor size to be set before starting the display server.

`Font=`
	Name of the font to be set before starting the
	display server. Please note that the theme can still override this option.

`EnableAvatars=`
	When enabled, home directories are searched for ".face.icon" images to
	display as their avatars. This can be slow on some file systems.
	When disabled, all avatars will be default. Themes may choose to hide
	them altogether.
	Default value is true.

[X11] section:

`ServerPath=`
	Path of the X server.
	Default value is "/usr/bin/X".

`SessionDir=`
	Comma-separated list of directories containing session files.
	Default value is "/usr/local/share/xsessions,/usr/share/xsessions".

`SessionCommand=`
	Path of script to execute when starting the user session. This script
	receives the value of the "Exec" setting in the ".desktop" file of the selected
	session and runs it.
	Default value is "@SESSION_COMMAND@".

`SessionLogFile=`
        Path to the user session log file, relative to the home directory.
        Default value is ".local/share/sddm/xorg-session.log".

`DisplayCommand=`
	Path of script to execute when starting the display server.
	The script will be executed as root when General.DisplayServer
	is "x11", otherwise as sddm user.
	Default value is "@DATA_INSTALL_DIR@/scripts/Xsetup".

`DisplayStopCommand=`
	Path of script to execute when stopping the display server.
	The script will be executed as root when General.DisplayServer
	is "x11", otherwise as sddm user.
	Default value is "@DATA_INSTALL_DIR@/scripts/Xstop".

`MinimumVT=`
	Minimum virtual terminal number that will be used
	by the first display. Virtual terminal number will
	increase as new displays added.
	This setting is no longer available since SDDM v0.20.

`EnableHiDPI=`
	Enables Qt's automatic HiDPI scaling.
	Can be either "true" or "false".
	Default value is "true".

The `XauthPath=` option is no longer necessary, libxau is used instead.

`/tmp/xauth_XXXXX`. This is necessary for to the use of `FamilyWild` entries.
