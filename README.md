## INTRODUCTION

SDDM is a modern display manager for X11 and Wayland sessions aiming to
be fast, simple and beautiful.
It uses modern technologies like QtQuick, which in turn gives the designer the ability to
create smooth, animated user interfaces.

SDDM is extremely themeable. We put no restrictions on the user interface design,
it is completely up to the designer. We simply provide a few callbacks to the user interface
which can be used for authentication, suspend etc.

To further ease theme creation we provide some premade components like a textbox,
a combox etc.

There are a few sample themes distributed with SDDM.
They can be used as a starting point for new themes.

## INSTALLATION

Qt >= 5.15.0 is required to use SDDM.

SDDM runs the greeter as a system user named "sddm" whose home directory needs
to be set to `/var/lib/sddm`.

If pam and systemd are available, the greeter will go through logind
which will give it access to drm devices.

Distributions without pam and systemd will need to put the "sddm" user
into the "video" group, otherwise errors regarding GL and drm devices
might be experienced.

## VIRTUAL TERMINALS

SDDM uses the VT_OPENQRY ioctl to find the next free VT to use.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### NVIDIA Prime

Add this at the bottom of the Xsetup script:

```sh
if [ -e /sbin/prime-offload ]; then
    echo running NVIDIA Prime setup /sbin/prime-offload, you will need to manually run /sbin/prime-switch to shut down
    /sbin/prime-offload
fi
```

### No User Icon

SDDM reads user icon from either ~/.face.icon or FacesDir/username.face.icon

You need to make sure that SDDM user have permissions to read those files.
In case you don't want to allow other users to access your $HOME you can use
ACLs if your filesystem does support it.

```sh
setfacl -m u:sddm:x /home/username
setfacl -m u:sddm:r /home/username/.face.icon
```

### Custom DPI

In order to set custom DPI for high resolution screens you should configure
Xorg yourself.  An easy way is to pass an additional argument to Xorg.

Edit ``/etc/sddm.conf``, go to the ``X11`` section and change ``ServerArguments`` like this:

```
ServerArguments=-nolisten tcp -dpi 192
```

to set DPI to 192.

As an alternative you can edit Xorg configuration ``xorg.conf``, please refer to the
Xorg documentation.
